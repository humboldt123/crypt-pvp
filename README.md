# Crypt PVP
The Crypt & Catacombs PVP Minecraft server, now on GitHub!

## Setup
Run `chmod +x start.sh` and `chmod +x reset.sh`, and ensure the start.sh script points to a valid Java 8 binary. You can then run `reset.sh` to create the world directory, and `start.sh` to start the server. If you need to hard-reset the map, stop the server and run `reset.sh`. 

## About
My friends and I originally made this map on an Aternos server in 2020. Later, I moved it to a spare server I had and we continued to add things to it until around 2021. I have it here on GitHub, after I downgraded to version `1.16.5` and installed ViaVersion so you can play on any version!

## Thanks
